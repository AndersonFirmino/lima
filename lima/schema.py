# Schema Metaclass ############################################################

class SchemaMeta(type):
    '''Metaclass of Schema.

    .. note::
       The metaclass :class:`SchemaMeta` is used internally to simplify the
       configuration of new :class:`Schema` classes. For users of the library
       there should be no need to use :class:`SchemaMeta` directly.

    When defining a new :class:`Schema` (sub)class, :class:`SchemaMeta` makes
    sure that the new class has a class attribute :attr:`__fields__` of type
    ``dict`` containing the fields for the new Schema.

    :attr:`__fields__` is determined like this:

    - The :attr:`__fields__` dicts of all base classes are copied (with base
      classes specified first having precedence).

      Note that the fields themselves are not copied - changing an inherited
      field would change this field for all base classes referencing this field
      as well. In general it is *strongly* suggested to treat fields as
      immutable.

    - Fields (Class variables of type :class:`lima.abc.FieldABC`) are moved out
      of the class dict and :attr:`__fields__`, overriding any fields of the
      same name therein.

    - If present, the class attribute :attr:`__lima_args__` is removed from the
      class dict and evaluated as follows:

      - Fields specified via an optional dict ``__lima_args__['include']`` (a
        mapping of field names to fields) are added to :attr:`__fields__`,
        overriding any fields of the same name therein.

        If two fields of the same name are defined, once as a class variable,
        and once via ``__lima_args__['include']``, a :exc:`ValueError` is
        raised.

      - Fields named in an optional sequence ``__lima_args__['exclude']`` are
        removed from :attr:`__fields__`. If only one field is to be removed,
        it's ok to supply a simple string instead of a list containing only one
        string. ``__lima_args__['exclude']`` may not be specified together with
        ``__lima_args__['only']``.

      - If in an optional sequence ``__lima_args__['only']`` is provided, *all
        but* the fields mentioned therein are removed from :attr:`__fields__`.
        If only one field is to remain, it's ok to supply a simple string
        instead of a list containing only one string. ``__lima_args__['only']``
        may not be specified together with ``__lima_args__['exclude']``.

        Think twice before using ``__lima_args__['only']`` - most of the time
        it's better to rethink your Schema than to remove a lot of fields that
        maybe shouldn't be there in the first place.

    .. versionadded:: 0.3
        Support for ``__lima_args__['only']``.

    :class:`SchemaMeta` also makes sure the new Schema class is registered with
    the lima class registry :mod:`lima.registry` (at least if the Schema isn't
    defined inside a local namespace, where we wouldn't find it later on).

# Schema ######################################################################

class Schema(abc.SchemaABC, metaclass=SchemaMeta):
    '''Base class for Schemas.

    Args:
        exclude: An optional sequence of field names to be removed from the
            fields of the new :class:`Schema` instance. If only one field is to
            be removed, it's ok to supply a simple string instead of a list
            containing only one string for ``exclude``. ``exclude`` may not be
            specified together with ``only``.

        only: An optional sequence of the names of the only fields that shall
            remain for the new :class:`Schema` instance.  If just one field is
            to remain, it's ok to supply a simple string instead of a list
            containing only one string for ``only``. ``only`` may not be
            specified together with ``exclude``.

        include: An optional mapping of field names to fields to additionally
            include in the new Schema instance. Think twice before using this
            option - most of the time it's better to incldue fields at class
            level rather than at instance level.

        many: An optional boolean indicating if the new Schema will be
            serializing single objects (``many=False``) or collections of
            objects (``many=True``) per default. This can later be overridden
            in the :meth:`dump` Method.

    .. versionadded:: 0.3
        The ``include`` parameter.

    Upon creation, each Schema object gets an internal mapping of field names
    to fields. This mapping starts out as a copy of the class's
    :attr:`__fields__` attribute.  (For an explanation on how this
    :attr:`__fields__` attribute is determined, see :class:`SchemaMeta`.)

    Note that the fields themselves are not copied - changing the field of an
    instance would change this field for the other instances and classes
    referencing this field as well. In general it is *strongly* suggested to
    treat fields as immutable.

    The internal field mapping is then modified as follows:

    - If ``include`` was provided, fields specified therein are added
      (overriding any fields of the same name already present)

    - If ``exclude`` was provided, fields specified therein are removed.

    - If ``only`` was provided, *all but* the fields specified therein are
      removed (unless ``exclude`` was provided as well, in which case a
      :exc:`ValueError` is raised.)

    Also upon creation, each Schema object gets an individually created dump
    function that aims to unroll most of the loops and to minimize the number
    of attribute lookups, resulting in a little speed gain on serialization.

    :class:`Schema` classes defined outside of local namespaces can be
    referenced by name (used by :class:`lima.fields.Nested`).
