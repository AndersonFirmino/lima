lima was started in 2014 by Bernhard Weitzhofer.


Acknowledgements
================

lima is heavily inspired by `marshmallow
<http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org>`_, from which it lifts most of its
concepts from.

Other than that, the author believes to have benefited a lot from looking at
the documentation and source code of other awesome projects, among them (in
alphabetical order):

- `django <https://www.djangoproject.com>`_
- `morepath <https://morepath.readthedocs.org>`_
- `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_

as well as the Python standard library itself. (Seriously, look in there!)


About the Image
===============

The Vicuña is the smallest and lightest camelid in the world. In this 1914
illustration [#]_, it is depicted next to its bigger and heavier relatives, the
Llama and the Alpaca.

Despite its delicate frame, the Vicuña is perfectly adapted to the harsh
conditions in the high alpine regions of the Andes. It is a mainly wild animal
long time believed to never have been domesticated. Reports of Vicuñas
breathing fire are greatly exaggerated.
